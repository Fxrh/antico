Antico is a Qt4/X11 Window/Desktop manager.
The goal is to create a Window/Desktop manager simple and fast. All parameters must be configured from few files, avoiding unnecessary complications, following the K.I.S.S. philosophy.
The whole project should be based solely on Qt4 libraries, without any other external dependencies (e.g. kdelibs ...).
