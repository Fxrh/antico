Antico is a Qt4 based Desktop Environment for Linux.
The goal is to create a simple and fast Desktop Environment.

This is a fork from the original code of Giovanni Cigala. See the Wiki for more infornation.

h1. What is being done?

Now, We have a three branches.
The ‘master’ branch is a fork of the ‘hmayer/antico’ that has a fork from the original source code. In this branch was made a few bug fixes and only that. Take care, we don’t expect someone to use it.

The ‘willbemaster’ branch contains a mix of the old code (original source code) with the new code. In the future, this branch will be master branch.

And finally, the ‘wm’ branch is the new Window Manager of the Antico. Now the development is focused in this branch.
